# What the product does
Owanbe Arena, is a mobile application for event planning that streamlines the organization process by linking users with vendors, venues, and crucial services for efficient planning. 
# Why it matters
Planning an event is often stressful, time-consuming, and fragmented. You have to find vendors separately, negotiate prices, coordinate schedules, and hope everything comes together. Owambe Arena changes that. We bring clarity and efficiency to event planning by creating a centralized marketplace. This means less stress for you, more structured processes for vendors, and ultimately, more successful and memorable events for everyone involved
